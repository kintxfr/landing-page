    <h3>Overcoming Cynicsm</h3>
<div>
    <p>Everybody scared of something. The difference is how to handle it. Failure inspires winners and defeats loser. Take the risk, don't play it too safe, losing would only make you go back in the first place before you started it. If you have low sources in you and you wanna success in whatever you want to be, go unbalanced. Balance will make you go nowhere. If you have any desire to reach that goal, you must focus. Do not do what most people do: put their few eggs in many baskets. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets and FOCUS: Follow One Course Until Successful.</p>
